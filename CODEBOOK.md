## Peer Assessments /Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Following are the Steps of Problem

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**As described in README.md file the script will generate a file named "tidy.txt"**

##### Following are the description of the variable of the file tidy.txt
    Variable Name   Description
  1. Subject: an identifier of type 'integer' for the subject code of training and test data
  2. Activity: a list of labels of activity of type 'factor' from file "activity_labels.txt" of data set folder
  3. Average_Var_Subject: the final result which is required i.e. the average of each variable for each activity and each subject of type 'numeric'

#### Note:
**You can find the description of subject codes in original code book of dataset**
